# Database migrations

## Goose

By default, LongBen uses [BlackBart](https://github.com/orov-io/BlackBart) witch in turn uses [pressly/goose](https://github.com/pressly/goose) as database control version.
Also, BlackBart expects to have .sql files to up and down versions.

Please, see [pressly/goose](https://github.com/pressly/goose) documentation.
